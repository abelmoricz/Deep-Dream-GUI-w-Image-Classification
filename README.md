# Deep Dream GUI with image classification
I realize this GUI is written a bit clumsily. Criticism is very welcomed.  
My focus was usability and intuitiveness (see User_Guide.pdf for more details)

Features:
* Creates Native features; a quick visualization of how a layer and channel are going to distort an image
* Standard Deep Dream algorithm imposed on a jpeg
* Inception classification of created images
* Visual menu for layers and 5049 different channels  
* Ability to compare different dreams without losing the information to recreate any of those dreams  
(because I was tired of choosing layers and channels randomly and waiting each time for what would result)  
 
    
Dependancies:  
PyQt5  
Pillow  
numpy  
tensorflow
